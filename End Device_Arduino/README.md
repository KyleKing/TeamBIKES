# End Device_Arduino

> Example Arduino code used in prototyping the smartlock

1. Arduino Sleep Mode
2. User presses button, hardware interrupt on pin2.
3. Arduino wakes up
4. NFC module starts and begins to read
5. User found, transmits UID to network
6. Network confirms user.
7. Arduino receives and servo begins unlock process
8. GPS location transmitted to network
9. User locks bike.
10. GPS location transmitted to network 
11. Network confirms 'locked state' 
12. Arduino enters Sleep Mode

 * User accounts
 * Maps
 * Cool bike icons

```
Change to the working directory

```bash
cd testProject/
```
Run Meteor

### Connecting with hardware
Note: designed for and Arduino or comparable device

Install NodeJS
Fetch the necessary Node packages. While inside the project folder, run this command:
```bash
npm install
```
While the Meteor app is running, open a new terminal window to run the node application in parallel.
```bash
node node-client.js
```
If you have a comparable device, try downloading the Arduino code from the __ADD FILE LINK HERE__ folder with a demo LED circuit to show functionality. See additional wiring schematics and complete code to replicate the system.

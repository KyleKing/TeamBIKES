# TODO

1. Export figures from thesis document into jpg/png format with proper numbering
2. Add image references in markdown format to said images
3. What to do with the [Table of Figures](Table-of-Figures.md)? Link to sections in the text?
4. Figure out how to center content - custom style sheet?
5. Add bold/italics for subheadings used throughout paper
6. Fix spacing between paragraphs and possibly at the start of each paragraph
7. Check that equations are formatted correctly
8. Check that all tables were imported and if not, rebuild in markdown format

Lots of other things...

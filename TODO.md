# TODO

1. Export figures from thesis document into jpg/png format with proper numbering

- Find figure in THESIS.docx. Select it and press ⌘+C, then open preview and press ⌘+N. This creates a new pdf from clipboard.
- Press ⌘+S to save the file. Use the naming convention lowercase `fig##`, where #28 would be fig28 and #1 would be fig01. Figures in the executive summary are given an "i", so they would be named `figi#`` (i.e. figi3). The appendix have an "a", "b", or "c" respectively and would be `fig(a/b/c)#`` (i.e. figb6).
- Save all of the files into one folder
- Once saved a sufficient number, open all in Preview (highlight the full list of files and right click -> open)
- In Preview pres ⌘+alt+2, which opens up a side panel. Press ⌘+A or shift select all of the files
- Go to File->Export Selected (''). This will open up a view of your finder. Click options and change the export format from PDF to JPEG. Create a new folder and save all of the images
- Send me the folder of the images and I can add them to the thesis!

2. Add image references in markdown format to said images
3. What to do with the [Table of Figures](Table-of-Figures.md)? Link to sections in the text?
4. Figure out how to center content - custom style sheet?
5. Add bold/italics for subheadings used throughout paper
6. Fix spacing between paragraphs and possibly at the start of each paragraph
7. Check that equations are formatted correctly
8. Check that all tables were imported and if not, rebuild in markdown format
9. Break down iteration and Discovery by subteam to make it more readable
10. Create tabs after every paragraph otherwise it becomes one non-ending line of garble

Lots of other things...

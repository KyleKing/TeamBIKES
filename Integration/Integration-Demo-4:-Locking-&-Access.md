## Integration Demo 4: Locking & Access
The fourth and final demonstration aimed to integrate the electrical and the mechanical components of the smartlock.  Using the system prototyped through the first three demos, the focus shifted to controllably locking or unlocking the bike lock using the entire communication pathway.  This demonstration focused on extending the complexity of the electronic system to directly control access to the lock.  Similar to the last demonstration, two NFC cards were used but only one was registered to the online database.  Either NFC card would trigger a query of the hosted web application database, but only the approved card would return an approved signal and thus a ‘y’ signifying a ‘yes’ message to the XBee.  Once triggered, a servo arm would rotate to start the unlocking process.  The servo arm provided enough force to compress the springs and move the pin constraining the rotating pieces of the designed smartlock to unlock.  As expected, when the NFC card registered with MongoDB communicated with the NFC reader, the servo motor was actuated to move the pin while use of the other NFC card did not result in any motion, sending an ‘n’ signifying a ‘no’ message to the XBee.  The fourth demonstration was successful in integrating the mechanical components of the product to the electronics to create a “smart” product.

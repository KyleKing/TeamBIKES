To run the Meteor application, enter the folder `cd Meteor Web Application`, then start the meteor application with `meteor` [if you don't have it already, make sure to install Meteor by visiting: [the official meteor website](https://www.meteor.com/). The first time loading may take some time as new packages are downloaded and the initial seed scripts are run to generate fake data.

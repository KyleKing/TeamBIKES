# Meteor Web Application

> The source code for the deployed web application available at [redbarbikes.com](https://redbarbikes.com)

To run the Meteor application, enter the folder `cd Meteor%20Web%20Application`, then start the meteor application with `meteor` [if you don't have it already, make sure to install Meteor by visiting: https://www.meteor.com/]. The first time loading may take some time as new packages are downloaded and the initial seed scripts are run to generate fake data.

# Literature Review

The first step towards developing an innovative product is to explore the existing work done in related fields.  Team BIKES elected to research the existing work by breaking the complex system into subtopics following the same divisions of subteams introduced in the previous section.  The business subteam was tasked with researching the current state of bikeshares, noting the different business strategies, costs, and effectiveness of various existing bikeshares.  The locking subteam focused on collecting information on what types of bicycle locks proved to be the most functional in regards to security and usability.  The access control subteam gathered information on currently existing systems used for close range wireless communication identification techniques, the corresponding security protocols, and the power needed for operating these components.  The geolocation subteam researched the various options available for maintaining constant communications with the bicycles in order to track and display the locations to users.  Compartmentalizing the research into specific fields, Team BIKES hoped to achieve a broader and deeper understanding of all of the existing technologies and strategies dealing with the teamâ€™s goal of developing the stationless bikeshare system.

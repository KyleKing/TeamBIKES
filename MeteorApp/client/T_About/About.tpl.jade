				p.CTA_quote As a group of UMD student, we built the best way to get around campus. We took the accessibility and convenience of biking and removed the unpleasant parts, such as fixing flat tires, maintenance, and not having your bike when you want it.
				p.CTA_quote.bold We make biking easy, affordable, and fun. Be one of the first RedBar bike riders!
